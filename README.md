# CC_Password-Validator
Creating a password validator to ensure it is STRONG enough:

A program that takes in a string as input and evaluates it as a valid password. The password is valid if it has at a minimum 2 numbers, 2 of the following special characters ('!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '&', '*'), and a length of at least 7 characters.
If the password passes the check, output 'Strong', else output 'Weak'.

Input Format:
A string representing the password to evaluate.

Output Format:
A string that says 'Strong' if the input meets the requirements, or 'Weak', if not.

Sample Input: 
Hello@$World19
